# Java concurrency in practice

## 1. Introduction
- history: in the past only one program was run on the computer. When OS was introduced it enabled cooperation of multiple programs on single machine. OS and multiple programs provides fairness, full resources utilization and convenience. 
  - threads: share memory, file handlers but have own stack, program counters and local variables
- existence of threads solves the problem of idling during IO actions
- makes is possible to decouple complex programs into smaller tasks that can be run independently
- livenes hazards: e.g. infinite pool or dead locks = program doesnâ€™t move forward
- performance hazards: e.g costs of context switching 
- threads over abstractions are used in many frameworks

## 2. Thread safety
- if multiple threads access the same mutable variable without synchronization program becomes broken, to avoid that we can:
    - don't share the state variable across threads 
    - make the state immutable
    - use synchronization whenever accessing the state
- OO principles like immutability and encapsulation helps to write thread safe code
- class is thread-safe if it behaves correctly when accessed from multiple threads, regardles of how they use that class (serially or interleaving)
- stateless objects are always thread-safe
- atomicity = closing all operations on an object in one action, other thread cannot see state of that object during modifications of that action
- *race condition* occurs when the correctness of a computation depends on the relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads by the runtime
- having compund actions that have more that one steps usage of atomic data structures in not sufficient as it still can cause race conditions, we need lock with broader scope
- *synchronized* block has two parts: reference to an object that will serve as the lock and a block of code that will be guarded by that block (static synchronized methods take thc Class object for the lock )
- reentracy: when the same thread calls more than one synchronized methos on a single object it is not blocked
- every shared, mutable variable should be guarded by exactly one locka (commong pattern is to synchornize path that accesses that variable)
- synchronized block should be as small as possible and contain no long running operations, avoid network or I/O calls!
- *writing correct concurrent programs is primarly about managing access to shared, mutable state*

## 3. Sharing objects
